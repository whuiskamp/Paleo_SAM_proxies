Text S1. Alternative illustrations of the reconstructions, selection of the precipitation proxies, 
statistical skill measures, and methodological details on the comparison plots, with 2 tables and 
18 figures.

Text S1 contains the follwing sections: S1. Alternative illustrations of the reconstructions, 
S2. Selection of the precipitation proxies, S3. Statistical skill measures, S4. Methodological 
details on the comparison plots (Figures 3c and 3d in the main text).

Table S1. Predictors used for the austral summer (DJF) precipitation reconstructions. Start and 
end years are AD. The non-instrumental predictors are taken from the SSA proxy network of Neukom et al. 
[2010]. Columns nine to twelve quantify the Spearman correlations of the proxies with the instrumental 
grid 1931-1995: The highest absolute correlation (max. r; correlation at the “best location”), the 
coordinates of the “best location” and the percentage of grid cells with significant (p<0.05) 
correlations. The last four columns indicate the average relative regression weight of each predictor 
in the years 1498, 1700, 1850 and 1931, respectively (see also Figure S13). Notice that some of the
documentary and early instrumental data have missing values in 1850.

network of Neukom et al. [2010]. Columns nine to twelve quantify the Spearman correlations 
of the proxies with the instrumental grid 1931-1995: The highest absolute correlation (max. r;

Figure S1. Spatial anomaly mean of the austral summer (DJF; top; 1498-1995) and winter 
(JJA; bottom; 1590-1995) reconstructions with respect to the 1931-1995 
climatology using the ensemble mean (black) and median (red) as reconstructed value, 
respectively. Green: CRU gridded data 1931-2006.

Figure S2. SSA mean austral summer precipitation reconstruction ensemble 1498-1995
relative to the 1931-1995 climatology. a) Interannual reconstruction anomalies. 
Blue to red lines: ensemble members. Black: ensemble median. Bold black: 30-year Gaussian 
filtered ensemble median. b) Percentiles of the reconstruction ensemble. Each line 
represents a percentile. The area between the black lines encloses all (100%) members; the 
area between the lowest blue line (1st percentile) and the highest blue line (99th 
percentile) blue lines encloses 98% of the members, and so on. c) and d) Same as a) and b) 
but for the 30-year Gaussian filtered ensemble members.

Figure S3. Same as Figure S2 but for austral winter and the period 1590-1995.

Figure S4. Distribution functions of the ensemble members of the summer precipitation 
reconstruction at four selected grid points: Tierra del Fuego (68°W/54°S; left), 
Chiloé Island (74°W/42°S; second), Buenos Aires (58°W/34.5°S, third) and Triple Frontier (tri-
border area of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, 54.5°W/25.5°S; right). The distribution 
functions are shown for the years AD 1500 (turquoise), 1600 (black), 1700 (red), 1800 (green) 
and 1900 (blue). All curves are normalized to a mean of zero and divided by the standard 
deviation of precipitation (1931-1995) at each location. The coloured dots show the 5th and 
95th percentiles, which were used to define the reconstruction uncertainties (see  main text).

Figure S5. Same as Figure S4 but for winter and the years 1600, 1700, 1800 and 
1900.

Figure S6. Mean 30-year running correlation between the predictor series (rbar; a) and spatial 
average of the ensemble mean RE (b) and r2 (c) for the austral summer (green; 1498-1995) and 
winter (blue; 1590-1995) reconstructions.

Figure S7. Spatial distribution of the RE values, averaged over the entire ensemble and 
reconstruction period for austral summer (left; 1498-1995) and winter (right; 1590-1995).

Figure S8. Top: Austral summer reconstruction ensemble median 1498-1995 based on 
all members (black), only the members with positive REs (red) and only the best 
percent of the members, based on the RE skills (green). Bottom: Histogram of the 
residuals between the median of all members and the members with positive REs only (left) 
and between the median of all members and the best percent of the members only (right).

Figure S9. Same as Figure S8 but for austral winter and the years 1590-1995.

Figure S10. Percentiles of the ensemble member distribution of the 30-year 
filtered summer precipitation reconstruction 1498-1995. a) ensemble of all members; b) 
ensemble of the best percent of members only (based on the RE skills); c) ensemble of 
a random selection of 100 members (1%); d) median curves of the three ensembles.

Figure S11. Same as Figure S10 but for austral winter and the years 1590-1995.

Figure S12. Spatial distribution of the root mean squared error of prediction 
(RMSEP; top) and r2 (bottom) of the reconstruction ensemble median compared with the 
instrumental target in the period 1931-1995. RMSEP values are relative to the instrumental 
standard deviation 1931-1995. Left austral summer; right austral winter.

Figure S13. Relative, spatially averaged weight of each predictor in the summer 
precipitation reconstruction in the years 1498, 1700, 1850 and 1931. See also Table S1.

Figure S14. Predictor with the largest regression weight at each grid cell in 
the summer precipitation reconstruction in the years 1498 (first panel) 1700 (second panel) 
1850 (third panel) and 1931 (last panel).

Figure S15. Same as Figure S13 but for winter and the years 1590, 1700, 1850 and 
1931. See also Table S2.

Figure S16. Same as Figure S14 but for winter and the years 1590, 1700, 1850 and 
1931.

Figure S17. 30-year filtered austral summer (top) and winter (bottom) reconstructions 
based on all (green) and the non-instrumental (red) predictors 1851-1995. Filtered 
uncertainty bands are shaded (uncertainties are defined as the root mean squared difference 
between theensemble median P and the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ensembles, 
respectively). Black: CRU gridded data 1931-2006.

Figure S18. Spatial Spearman correlation coefficients between the reconstructions based on
all and only the non-instrumental predictors, respectively. Left: austral summer, right: 
austral winter. Period: 1851-1995. Correlations above 0.16 are significant at the 5% 
level (all values are significant except one grid cell in summer).
